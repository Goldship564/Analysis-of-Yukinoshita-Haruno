Abstract

Forged through meticulous character analysis, this paper challenges the Oregairu community’s tendency to dismiss Haruno Yukinoshita as a manipulative or aggravating figure, 
unveiling an elusive gem—a fragile girl aching to break free yet shadowed by fear, yearning for a genuine soul, perhaps Hachiman Hikigaya, 
or her own strength to roam the unknown forever. Through the light novel (Volumes 1-14), anime (Seasons 1-3), and Zoku game, 
it blends psychological and lyrical lenses to probe her cynicism, vulnerability, and passion, enriched by her fraught bond with Yukino (see Appendix), 
revealing a capacity for fierce loyalty and radiant devotion that beckons readers to cherish her intricate beauty.
